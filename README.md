## 2024

- Day 3: could handle nested mul(mul(...), 3)
- Day 4: make the "X-shaped MAS" search function generic to the keyword & intersecting letter
- Day 6: rough code, could probably make smarter use of maps and fast "forward" to nearest obstacle rather than step each iteration
- Day 7: probably a backtracking solution
- Day 10: misreading the part 1 made me write the solution to part 2 first
